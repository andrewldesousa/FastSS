It's very basic and will only work on non js based sites

This is a great introduction, and should be enough to play around and make work for you.

Dependecies:

    pip install requests bs4

Template

    # dependencies
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    # main url to scrape
    MAIN_URL = ""

    # get the html and convert to soup.
    request = requests.get(MAIN_URL)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(request.content, 'html.parser')

    # find the main element for each item
    all_items = soup.find_all("li", {"class": "item-list-class"})

    # empty dictionary to store data, could be a list of anything. i just like dicts
    all_data = {}

    # initialize key for dict
    count = 0

    # loop through all_items
    for item in all_items:
        # get specific fields
        item_name = item.find("h2", {"class": "item-name-class"})
        item_url = item.find("a", {"class": "item-link-class"})
	
        # save to dict
        all_data[count] = {
            # get the text
            "item_name": item_name.get_text(),
            # get a specific attribute
            "item_url": item_url.attrs["href"]
        }
	
        # increment dict key
        count += 1
	
    # do whats needed with data
    print(all_data)
	

I will try my best to answer any questions or problems you may come across, good luck and have fun. Web scraping can be so fun :)
