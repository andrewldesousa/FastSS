Hi Guys,

Just a quick motivational speech as this week it has really paid off for me.

I've been learning python for around 6 months now and have found myself in the perpetual tutorial loop as I think most newbies find themselves.

But now I started a new job which allows the use of python and in the first week I took on a new task from my new boss.

Long story short, I took a task they allowed 3 weeks for the creation of (excel surveys to be used by internal team leads) and had it done in two days; around 15 spreadsheets are populated with 5 to 10 changing questions, and will require analysis thereafter.

They fully expected me to spend weeks putting together said spreadsheets and all their permutations, and email them out.

Instead I created a csv of all the data required and took the data and used python to generate the surveys, updating when changes happen in the back end.

The survey files are then formatted by openpyxl and spat out with a filename title as each team lead.

Any changes to the structure of the surveys mean just changing one or two lines of code, not going into every single file to make all the changes.

The script takes 0.75 seconds to run.

They allocated 3 weeks.

Needless to say, worth it, and everyone is happy!

So if you're stuck in tutorial hell, my advice is to find a work task to accomplish because I reckon I learnt as much in the past 2 days with this task as I have learnt in the past month.

Edit: meant to say, I was only able to get this reasonably high paying job because I told them I started learning python 6 months ago and will be using it to automate tasks. 

Without that, I wouldn't have got it (about a 75 to 100% pay increase on my last job) 

Good luck!
