Hey all,

I have an interview post 2 days for the position of a python developer hence I wanted to know what type of questions can I expect in the following areas :-

1. Multi-threading and Multiprocessing (process, pool) in Python

2. OOP Concepts: Metaclasses, Operator Overloading, Inheritance, different types of methods, magic methods

3. Decorators and Generators

4. Pytest: Fixtures and Mocks

5. Profiling in Python

6. Using Pickle and Customizing Pickle



I would be grateful if y'all can throw some light on this. Its my first python-dev interview kind of clueless on what to expect in the above areas.

Thanks

Stay safe and Take Care
