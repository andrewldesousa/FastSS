I'm only on chapter 3, but I have learned a lot. I'm able to create little programs such as a calorie calculator, small adventure game, dice simulator, etc. I'm having a lot of fun and I'm really excited for the future.

When I was learning html/css/js, I thought that's what programming was. I never enjoyed it and it was hard for me to learn. Python and ATBS has sparked something inside of me that makes me feel that fuzzy feeling again. Yipee!

I just really wanted to share with someone.
