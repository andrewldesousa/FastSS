Hey All,

I'm having the hardest time understanding for loops in Python.

Could someone explain what is happening in this example? I see we have a variable v. I somewhat understand that "range" is built into Python. I don't understand the output.

    for v in range(3, 10, 3):
        print(v)

Output:

3

6

9

I keep seeing examples online but they lose me every time. Thank you in advance.

\*Edit Thanks to everyone who replied. My misunderstanding was not knowing what range was fully doing.  

range(start, stop, step)
