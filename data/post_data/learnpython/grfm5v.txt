I am a professional Python developer and I mostly focus on building web applications and backends with Django.

I have always wanted to make a youtube channel and post tutorial videos, and thanks to the lockdown here I have some free time now to actually do it.

I was thinking of starting with a live stream, where I will create a small but functional Django app from scratch. I'll explain everything as I go along, and will take questions from the chat. It should be around 2 hours long.

If you think you would be interested in something like this, message me or leave a comment here. Even one interested person will be enough motivation for me!

EDIT -

Thanks, everyone for kind words :)

I should clarify some things that people are asking in the comments

1. Yes, the stream would be recorded and available to view later.
2. A friend who runs a charity organization had asked me to make an app to simplify some of the things she was managing using google sheets. That's the app that I will be making. It would be a really basic Django app and will focus on customizing the Django Admin Panel and using the Role-based access system in Django.
3. I would emphasize that this is **NOT** a 2-hour tutorial about how to write Django apps. I won't be able to go into that much detail given the short amount of time. But I will try my best to make things easy to understand
4. If you are a Django developer already, I don't think there would be that much for you to gain from the stream. However, I loved some of the ideas people have suggested in the comments, and if I do stream more, I'll definitely go into the more complex things to do in Django.
