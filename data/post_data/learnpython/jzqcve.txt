A few days ago, I requested help with a couple lines of code for an embroidery project as a gift to my dad, a computer science professor. You guys offered me a lot of feedback and also requested to see the final product. Welp, here it is! ([link to imgur album](http://imgur.com/gallery/ta90l8K)) It's not perfect (looking at you, wonky edges) but it *is* made with love. I had only done a tiny bit of coding before this project but I can confidently say this is the longest I've ever spent on twelve lines of code.

Thank you everyone for the help! I received a lot of great suggestions after I had already cut the fabric and started stitching. Even if I didn't use your suggestion, I still appreciate it.

I won't be able to see his reaction in person since we're spending Christmas apart for the first time in my life due to the pandemic. It makes me sad but it's the right thing to do. He's a great dad and I want him to stick around for a while so Google Hangouts will be good enough for us this year.

Thanks again and stay safe.
