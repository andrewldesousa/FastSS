I'm trying to learn how to make a python programs by looking through existing programs in a similar premise as what I'd like to achieve (learning by looking at examples). But one thing I'm having difficulty with is finding out how these github repos are organized.

So far ([in the repo I have I'm viewing](https://github.com/qtile/qtile)) I know that `bin` usually means terminal/command-line commands, `docs` is typically documentation (as one might expect), `test` is self explanatory, but some things I don't know is `rpm` and `stubs`, amongst others.

Is there a resource to learn how python/git programs are organized? And what to expect when looking through repos?
