Edit 1: Thanks so much, everyone! Here's my final draft ([link](http://imgur.com/gallery/RgpfUjJ)). I'll post a picture of the piece when I finish it. :)

Not homework help!

I want to embroider a simple program for a Christmas gift to my dad, a computer science professor and self-proclaimed "geek". Here's what I came up with. ([link](http://imgur.com/gallery/EyjT9iE))

Thanks so much!
