Hey! I recently picked up python 3.8 in quarantine (about 6-7 days ago) and I've been watching [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org)'s tutorial on it (still not finished, I'm at the part about nested loops), and was wondering what are some simple yet challenging beginner python projects I could try and make to try and actively learn rather than just be stuck in tutorial purgatory.
