I realized this is why I never get anywhere with programming. I learn and learn and maybe do some simple things, but once it comes down to "do a fibonacci function" or "create TicTacToe", "create a calculator"... I just CANT. I don't have that kind of thinking. And then I get depressed and angry at myself and give up for another year. It might be that time again. What's the point of going through all of Corey Schafers videos when I can't apply the simplest things once it comes down to creating something. 

Am I really that stupid and everyone is able to do these thing from scratch?

I actually gave up exactly on TicTacToe last time too.

Idk where I'm going with this, I guess I just want to know if people are really able to do this just like that, without googling the solution.

Makes me feel incredibly stupid and defeated once I Google it and its a 2 minute thing

**EDIT**: Thanks everyone for so many helpful comments! Im reading them all and will take the advice to heart
