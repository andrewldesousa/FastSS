I've been learning python for about 2 days, and this is my first independent program.

It's a *very very* simple short survey, that only took about 10 minutes, but I am still kinda proud of it

    print('PERSONAL SURVEY:')
    
    name = input('What is your name? ')
    
    if len(name) < 3:
     print('ERROR: Name too short; must exceed 3 characters')
    elif len(name) > 50:
     print('ERROR: Name too long; must not exceed 50 characters')
    else:
     print('Nice name')
    
    favcolor = input("What's your favorite color? ")
    
    if len(favcolor) <= 2:
     print('ERROR: Word too short; must exceed 2 characters')
    elif len(favcolor) > 50:
     print('ERROR: Word too long; must not exceed 50 characters')
    else:
     print('That is a nice color!')
    
    age = input('How old are you? ')
    
    if int(age) < 10:
     print("Wow, you're quite young!")
    elif int(age) > 60 and int(age) <= 122:
     print("Wow, you're quite old!")
    elif int(age) > 122:
     print('Amazing! You are the oldest person in history! Congrats!')
    elif int(age) >= 14 and int(age) <= 18:
     print('Really? You look like a college student!')
    elif int(age) >= 10 and int(age) <= 13:
     print('Really? You look like a 10th grader!')
    else:
     print('Really? No way! You look younger than that, could have fooled me!')
    
    print(f'''Your name is {name}, your favorite color is {favcolor}, and you are {age} years old.
    
    *THIS CONCLUDES THE PERSONAL SURVEY. HAVE A NICE DAY*''')
