I'm not very new to programming but, started python this month by doing Automate the boring stuff. (author posted the free course a while ago here).

This script uses PRAW an amazing python wrapper for Reddit API. (kudos for that).

Why did I write this? Reddit is the best thing on the internet (at least for me). I've saved a lot of content but rarely had the time to go through everything. Even when I did it way harder to find posts.

Also, Reddit has a 1000 save limit.

So decided why not give it a go?

**Github:** [link](https://github.com/nooneswarup/export-archive-reddit-saved)

This is how it works:

* Download/Clone the files
* Edit the config file (more info on Github Readme)
* Install pythonv3.x and pip install PRAW
* Run the batch file or open the python file and compile.
* (Make sure to put assets(CSS and JS files) in the folder created, if it doesn't automatically copy them)

feedback/ suggestions/ critique's.

Also: Code is a clutter(Can't help with it)

Known issues can be viewed on Github Readme.

EDIT: For those who asked me to post a screen recording, r/learnpython does not allow to post links/videos so you can view it [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/freeezer98/comments/ccn8dd/how_to_download_reddit_saved_posts_using_this/)

EDIT 2: CSS, JS file can be edited for much cooler designs. I'm not good at that so bear with me.

Also, it's easy to add options like is\_NSFW, is\_Gilded and many more. Incase you need anything don't hesitate to ask.
