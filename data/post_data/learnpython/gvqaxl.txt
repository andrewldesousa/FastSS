Hi, as a new programmer i often find myself browsing  r/ learnpython and stackexhange and whilst im very thankful of the feedback and help ive been given, i can't help but notice things, especially on stackechange where this phenomena seems most rampant.

What does it mean for your code to be unpythonic? and why do certain individuals care so much?

forgive me, i may be a beginner but is all code not equal? why should i preference "pythonic" code to unpyhtonic code if it all does the same thing. i have seen people getting scolded for the simple reason their code isnt, pythonic, so whats the deal with this whole thing?
