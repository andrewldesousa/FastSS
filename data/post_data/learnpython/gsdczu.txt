Hi :)

I have been learning python programming for the last two months +- but i was always scared to start a project and fail in the middle.

i have done a couple of scripts that to little stuff but this is the first time that i tried to build an official project that is not following a tutorial and with git, github, python structure and all of those stuff.

i call it..... Flasher!! 

it is a simple Flask web with a  button where every time the user presses it it links him to a random flash game from the past. 

it is not really complex, I will link here to the github page but i will also write here that my objective was to take a bunch of little topics I have learned in the last month-month and half, configure them to work together and make them do something lol.

obviously there is a \*91025915 better way to build what I built but I am still extremely proud of it because in the end I was able to think of something and build it from scratch from start to end, something I would not imagine I would be able to do around a month ago :)

i want to also thank the people of the python and learnpython subreddit that have helped and inspired me to program :)

now i will shut up and link to my project!
