Hello everyone. I am in my 30s and in the past 2 years I have started to be attracted by programming even if I come from a totally different field (journalism and international relations with a focus on conflicts and human rights). I didn't know anything about it so I just started reading and watching videos about the various languages and their applications. I have started following a SQL course (I know it's not a language) and even if I understood the concepts I have never understood how to use it in a real life situation. Then I read about Python. Since I am really interested in things like data, Osint techniques and in automating processes I thought that this would be a really great program to learn. So I started reading books and following some courses. Even if they say that it's a very easy language to learn and that I should just start doing projects lately I have started to feel a little bit hopeless. Everything it's incredibly hard for me. For loops, functions...even only trying to start a project on Pycharm makes me crazy. The working directories are always wrong and most of times I end just feeling stupid because in so many months I haven't even been able to start a small project. Sometimes I think that it's because I am too old to learn from 0 or just too stupid despite having spent a great amount of time trying on Python and despite having a huge desire to learn. Did everyone else face these issues? Thank you
