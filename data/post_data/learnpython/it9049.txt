I used to have admin rights (data analyst) at my previous employer. 

After starting my new role, as a sales analytics manager, I can’t even get python (or even a database application) installed...

Other than personal projects, any other creative ways to continue using python?

***Edit: WOW! Thanks for all the feedback. I’ve addressed it to my manager and we’ve agreed to request it again after I propose a proper justification that backs up my needs to download Python. If it gets denied by IT again, my manager might go straight to the CEO but I don’t know if that’ll be necessary. Until then, I’ll have to familiarize myself with VBA again!***

Suggestions to consider: 
- VM
- Anaconda
