Thanks everyone who helped me out in preparing for the interview went great!,I passed the first roundðŸ™‚

(link to initial post : https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/glxpe4/what_type_of_questions_can_i_expect_in_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Now I was just wondering like what sort of questions can I expect on the following topics

List,Tuples,Dictionaries,Arrays,Functions etc.

I am not able to figure out what questions are to be expected on the above things,I just know their syntax and methods thats all.

Any guidance or help would be appreciated
