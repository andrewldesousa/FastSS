Hello, I recently bought two courses off Udemy both being complete crash courses on Excel and Python. I (only) know VBA programming in Excel can be used to automate stuff outside Excel like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and so can Python. However, Iâ€™m at two minds over what to choose since both claim to do the same thing. Any sort of information would be appreciated! Thanks  ðŸ˜Š
