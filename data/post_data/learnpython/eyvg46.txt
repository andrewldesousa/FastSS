I've had some spare time to parse this subreddit to help those in need. It is very apparent that not many know how to use code blocks or how to use backticks when making a post.

You can use a a single or triple backtick on the front AND back of the word
which is [this guy](https://imgur.com/a/1ZuYv8j) on your keyboard (not the tilde ~)
to get formatting like `this`. In your editor it should look like \`this\`.

As for code, use FOUR spaces at the start of each new line to indicate code.

    for i in [1,2,3]:
        print(i)

This helps others read your code and encourages other to help. No one wants to read spaghetti code on top of it being unformatted.

Thanks in advanced!

Edit:

From /u/SoNotRedditingAtWork:

> New reddit's text editor also has these cool buttons called **Inline Code** and **Code Block** that ya'll can use to properly format your code snippets. The** Code Block** option is real nice because your code will keep its whitespace when you copypasta it into an open block in the editor.

From /u/lanemik:

>Also, if you're using the new Reddit, you can type cmd-j on mac to

     enter a code block

> You can also do cmd-k [create a link](https://www.google.com/). Or do cmd-i to get into or out of italics. Obvs **cmd-b gets you into or** out of bold. I'm not too sure about all the others. I don't know if there is a key combo that gets you to inline code or blockquotes or super/subscript.

From /u/TSPhoenix:

> Btw you can use escape characters on reddit (but not in code blocks). Type \`test\` and it will display `test` in the text of your post so you can more cleanly explain how to get test.
