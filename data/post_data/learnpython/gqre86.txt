Most online python interpreters suck because they try to be complete IDEs with bloated designs and none of them work on mobile.

I spent the coronavirus lockdown time building a simple python interpreter that doesn't suck, has a simple design and works on mobile. It also has a nifty dark mode feature.

I would appreciate any feedback on the tool - in terms of UI/UX, security, packages, feature requests and I would be happy to answer any questions regarding how I built it.
