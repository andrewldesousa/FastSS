I've been learning python for a while and feel like I know it on an intermediate level. Yesterday, I decided to take a look at the official  [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) because I never had before. I ended up staying up until 2am reading it because I'm a fucking nerd.

I'm going to be honest, for a total programming beginner, I believe this "tutorial" might scare them off. It's pretty technical and doesn't hold back on jargon and details that would confuse an absolute newbie.

But for someone who is either:

1. Already comfortable with the basics of python and programming concepts
2. Coming from another language

the tutorial is great! It gives a level of detail into the language that you don't get in most regular tutorials.

It can be dry if you're not really passionate about programming, but the information you'll pick up and the deeper understanding you'll gain will be worth the time to read the entire thing.

If you're looking for the next step to deepen your understanding, check it out. It's definitely not just another oversimplified "basics" tutorial.
