I have been dabbling in programming for a few years now, but with a full-time job and other commitments, I never really made the time to create something truly useful. 

I went through the web scraping phase, made simple scripts to move files out of my downloads folder and place them into the respective folder based on their extension, and I was quite content with this kind of simple stuff. 

But now I finally feel like I made something worth while! While quarantined with the fam, I overheard my mom trying to resize 100s of product images for her e-com site. 

Mom is not technologically incapable, she knows how to google "Image Resizer" or something along those lines, but she always does them one-by-one. A huge time sink. I did not know she does this every time she gets new images from her vendors. 

**Mom:** "This is going to take me forever! This vendor never sends me the right image size, every quarter this takes hours, ARGHHH!"

**Python Noob:** "I think I can get this done in a few minutes for you, mind if I give it a go?"

After some googling I proceeded to use the Pillow module to iterate through all of the images in a folder and plop them into a new folder, nicely resized. This took me like 10 mins to resize all of the images, she was blown away. 

I went one step further though because I knew this was a recurring thing for her. I needed to make a proper desktop icon for her to clickity clack and immediately have 100s of images resized anytime. A few youtube videos later, and she was able to double click an icon on her desktop to resize product images anytime without needing the command prompt. 

It took just a few minutes to teach her how to put the original images in folder X, double click the image resizing icon, and the new images would be in folder Y shortly thereafter. 

Needless to say, she is super happy to be able to resize all of these images in bulk, saving her HOURS of her time. I am on Cloud 9 as well because I feel like I've finally put my programming wherewithal to good use by helping my mom with something so practical. 

I'm excited to continue learning new ways to make life easier with the "magic" of python. 

TL;DR - Finally did a thing in python and feeling quite good about it!
