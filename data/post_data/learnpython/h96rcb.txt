Hello everyone, 

I've been coding for a number of months now, and I frequently forgot some of the most basic commands/uses. Granted, I easily know where to find the answers so I just look them up, but I just feel like...am I just a bad coder or is this a common problem? Sometimes I'll just forget the command to open a file, or how to call a dictionary.
