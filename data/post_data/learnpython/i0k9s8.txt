However, it'd make my day if you made your own account.

After about three (or was it four?) months, I proudly present to you,
my first major python project, a website called **Ocean Personality
Visualiztion**. Before this, I made a small Hangman game as my first
project and then a cli based login system. 

I used Django as my web framework, and a free HTML template I grabbed
off the internet (I have no frontend experience). That might be a
reason why the website still looks kinda sloppy.



Though I have made a thorough README explaining what the website 
does, I will explain it a bit here.

> A website to visualize your personality using graphs and compare it 
> with others. It asks you a series of questions and analyzes your 
> inputs to create an easy to understand graph. It also provides you 
> an easy way to share these results with your peers and compare your 
> personalities. It is based on the OCEAN personality model which is 
> the most acceptable model to measure personality used by researchers.

What all did I learn from this major (to me) project?

* The actual website development and how different components go 
  together to make a functioning website.
* I need to learn Javascript.
* Deployment is hard- I tried to go the hard way at first by not
  choosing Heroku (it streamlined the process a lot) but I had to scramble back to it because how hard it is to deploy a dynamic website.
* How awesome and Python is as a programming language. I absolutely
  adore it.
* Documentation sucks
* Testing sucks

Anyways, I am still mighty proud of what I have done and I invite you
all to checkout the website and provide some feedback. If you'd like
to make any pull requests, the repo link is above.

***PS***: If anyone can help me fix my tests, I will be forever
grateful to you.
