I've been learning python for about a month now. I started with automate the boring stuff like so many others have. Since then I have made some small games to practice. I am currently working on a hangman game and needed a list of words to use. I found a list of words and copied the whole thing to a .text file but it came with extra stuff I didn't need. So instead of manually deleting everything I didn't need I made a python script to do it for me. GREATEST FEELING EVER.
