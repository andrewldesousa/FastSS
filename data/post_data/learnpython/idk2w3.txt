Im using it for a couple of different things, but learning how to manipulate pdfs has been great as I often have to combine multiple pdfs and extract tables to bring into excel. I also had a chance to use it yesterday with matplotlib and pandas to bring in some quarterly income and expense numbers for forecasting and export some tables and their related histograms to pdf for a presentation. Originally I was more interested in the data engineering portion of my job since I knew SQL really well, but now I'm also starting to get interested in the data science side of things. Ive started to explore trying to build some predictive analytics models with some datasets that i have access to and seeing if i can possibly add any value there as we dont have a data science department.
