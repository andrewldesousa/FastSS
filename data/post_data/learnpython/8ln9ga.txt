Hey, I made and ran a workshop / demonstration as part of a series of events my university is running; 'High Performance Python'.

 I have all of the code and presentations on Github, so I thought I'd share it with you all in case anyone finds it useful. [Github Link](https://github.com/LukeRoantree4815162342/QUB_DW_HighPerformancePython)

The workshop had two parts;

### A Python crash course / refresher -
[PythonRefresher](https://github.com/LukeRoantree4815162342/QUB_DW_HighPerformancePython/blob/master/PythonRefresher.ipynb)

### High Performance Python -
[HighPerformance](https://github.com/LukeRoantree4815162342/QUB_DW_HighPerformancePython/tree/master/HighPerformance)

Additionally, we have a tutorial for building a simple tic-tac-toe application;
[PythonApp](https://github.com/LukeRoantree4815162342/QUB_DW_HighPerformancePython/tree/master/Python_App)

Hope this is useful to someone, it was fun to make at least. 
Message me if you have suggestions, or even better fork the repo and make a pull request.
