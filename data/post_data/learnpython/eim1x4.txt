By now I know pretty much all the basics and things like generators, list comps, object oriented programming, magic methods and etc. But I see people on github writing extremely compilcated code and stuff that just goes right over my head, and I wonder how they got so good. When I look in this subreddit, most of the people just say code, code, code. I completely agree that helps in the beginning stages when you try to grasp the basics of python, it helped me alot too. But I don't see how you can continue to improve by only coding. Cause coding only reinforces and implements what you already know. Is just coding the projects you want to do, gonna get you up to the level that the professionals are at? How did they get so good? I kinda feel like I’ve hit a dead end and don’t even know what to do anymore. I'd like to know people's opinion on this, and what it really takes to become a professional python developer, or even a good programmer as a whole whether it be python or not.
