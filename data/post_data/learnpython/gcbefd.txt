I've been thinking of organizing a group of people similar to my own level who would like to learn together.  I'd be interested in potentially hoping on a zoom periodically and helping each other through problems and just generally navigate the world of python and programming at large. 

No real solid ideas so please share any that you have as well if you'd be interested!

I've personally just finished Python Crash Course and have built a few small programs such a game of 21 that you play against a computer dealer. However if there are enough people who are interested we could have a few different levels.
