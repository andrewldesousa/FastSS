I had been fiddling with the language for a bit until a reorganization recently changed my role.

I went from “jack  of all trades” data engineer/ support guy / DBA to site reliability engineer. My new boss tasked me to automate all the boring stuff I was in charge of so I could focus on my new engineering duties.

In over a month, my code has gotten more succinct and effective. Things “click” now as I see real world applications for it. 

All I want to say is don’t despair. Yeah things can  be tough and confusing but it helped me to apply the language in my job. Automate the boring stuff, people!!

Hang in there. You got this.

PS: I am still a newbie, no doubt.

EDIT: a word.
