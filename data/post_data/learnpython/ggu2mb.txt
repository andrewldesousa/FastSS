Hi everyone,

I just finished my first Python data analysis project, and being a total beginner, I could really use some other perspectives as to the quality of my final product. I plan on building a portfolio of similar projects and using it for applying to social science research assistant jobs where some programming and analysis ability is highly preferred. Since I am entirely self-taught, I need some concrete examples of what I can do to share with potential employers.

With that said, while I'm sure there are areas that could be improved, would my project be worth sharing with some edits? Or is it actually just a total flaming trash heap that should be scrapped entirely? Positive critique and helpful suggestions appreciated!

Edit: Wow, I did *not* expect to wake up to so many comments and upvotes! I really needed this boost, to be honest. I'm so grateful for everyone's kindness and suggestions, and I'm definitely going to go back and try and tweak some things! I hope I can pay it forward one day, but for now, to fellow noobs who are trying to set up their first project - just go do it! I basically just forced myself to create something after learning the basics, and it really helps the learning process to break things down and figure out how they work outside of a guided tutorial. Keep coding!

Edit 2: I've uploaded a new version of the project since this was posted, taking into account some of the suggestions everyone has made. It's still not perfect, but I think it's time to move onto learning with new projects.
