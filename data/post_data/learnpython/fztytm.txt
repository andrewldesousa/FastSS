I have been on this group for awhile now and have (can say frequently) posted suggested solutions when I see people struggle with their coding problems or need some advice, but what I don't understand is **"WHY ARE THEY DELETING THE ORIGINAL POST ONCE THEY HAVE GOT THEIR SOLUTIONS?"** I see this "symptom" happened pretty often, especially with newcomers. Not trying to be rude or anything, but when we helped someone with a problem, I thought it is because we want our solution to be seen by others so other members can learn from other people's mistakes and problems.

Can someone explaining the reason behind this "I am deleting my post since I have got my answer now" symptom.?
