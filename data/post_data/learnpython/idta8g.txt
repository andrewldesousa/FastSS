I've been programming in Python for a while now. I'm familiar with all the basic functionalities and have been working on algorithms for a while as well. My question is, how do I actually build something solid with Python (say, an application, or a program that automatically replies to all my emails with a pre-written message)? I simply have no clue how to do that. I'm only familiar with the "logic" of Python, but I can't "build" anything with it. Where do I start? What do I learn?
