For the first time in my life, I wrote a Python program from scratch to automate my work. My boss gave me the task of copy/pasting all the fields from a long online application form to a word doc and I wrote a code to do that in 5 minutes. It shaved off at least 40 minutes from my workload. It might not seem like much, but I'm over the moon :)

Edit 1: Thank you all for your kind words. Being part of this community has helped me immensely. I’m truly grateful to have found it.

For those who asked for the code, here it goes - https://github.com/abhisu30/OnlineFormExtraction

Edit 2: For those who asked, no I didn’t use my work computer. My boss asked me to email her the word file with the form fields so I executed this code on my home computer and emailed it to her.
