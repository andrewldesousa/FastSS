Hi. First of all, I'm sorry I know that this question has been answered already but I wasn't able to get my answer from that. I've been using python for almost 2 years and can say that I'm pretty good at it and improving day by day. I want to make some make money off python even if it's a small amount. I'll learn most of the things if it's not super hard. Also, I'm a teen and due to this lockdown stuff I can't work offline anywhere. It would be a huge help if someone can guide me!
