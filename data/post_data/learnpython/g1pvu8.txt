Hi everyone!

Just started learning how to code recently and bought the course on Udemy.

I've been finding it really difficult to keep up, the author explains things really fast and gives me 20 new concepts every 20 minutes, if I decide to spend 2-3 hours learning, it's just too much information to soak in.

I've made it through 60% of the course but I feel like I can't do much because I've been absorbing so much info, but I didn't get to do any exercises.

Please let me know how to cope with this. Is there a website with really easy python exercises? Should I not worry about memorizing it all?

**UPDATE: THANKS, EVERYONE! HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED:**

1. Don't rely on the video alone, use the book.
2. Don't rush it, if you didn't understand something, don't advance.
3. Play with the code. When a new concept is introduced, play with it and explore many other possibilities.
4. Take notes; Pretend you are teaching it to someone else.
5. Search on youtube/google for more information about the topic you are learning about.
6. Learn less and code more. The best way to learn is by practicing.
7. Take breaks, have fun and stay hydrated!
