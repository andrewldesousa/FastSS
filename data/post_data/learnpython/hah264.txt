Started on the 1st of June, after 2 weeks of "from zero to hero" video course I decided to try something "heroic".  Asked my wife yesterday "what can I do to simplify your work?". She is a translator and one of the client has most of works in PPT.  For some reason PPT word count is never accurate, well at least for invoicing purpose.  
So they agree to copy and paste contents in word and count.

I just write a script that read all the text contents in PPT and save them in a text file.  So she can easily count the words there.

Although it took me almost 4 hours for only 25 lines of code, but I am still happy that I can apply what I've learned so far.
