And I am really happy. I am still an undergraduate student near my  graduation. After getting the internship it was like it didn't have  anywhere people to tell my internship or people who were that happy for  me. Throughout my college I thought if I am even worthy of doing  anything, That whatever am I studying is there anything new I am doing  or in a better way. But I have to keep pushing because I didn't have  many options. My 2 years passed and it was like I was still at ground  zero. But as I was near my graduation I thought I need to get my shit  together so I tried learning things from the basics again but this time  with all my might. I put all my efforts this time thinking I still have  time to turn around things. And after I was done with courses unsure of  my skills I thought of applying for internships. I applied for so many  but haven't heard from most of them up till now. But one of them  responded and after some interviews and tests hired me. It's a paid  internship, It not might be that big, but for me, it's enough to make me  believe in myself once again. I was always worried that whatever I am  studying doesn't payoff, how am I going to my parents who put this much  effort in this but now it feels like I am not a total loser I might  stick around. Prove my worth. I just need to let this all out.
