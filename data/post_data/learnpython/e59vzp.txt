During the month of December, you can also use DEC2019 to sign up for $14 instead of the usual $50: https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=DEC2019

Due to the way Udemy now does promotions, I'm limited in how many discount codes I can make each month, so there's no way for me to make more after the 72 hour period, which ends roughly Wednesday night 7pm Pacific time.

I'll have the second edition of the book in HTML format online, uh, soon. I've had some delays getting it ready. The online course follows the 1st edition, and I won't be able to update it until probably mid-2020. I'll write up a blog post about what exactly is new in the 2nd edition soon too. Go ahead and get started: the Udemy course is still useful.

The 1st edition is free online under a Creative Commons license, but if you want to buy a print copy of the book, I recommend getting it directly from the publisher instead of Amazon; you get DRM-free ebook copies in PDF, Kindle, and epub formats for free with the print book: https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2
