Hello, 

I've got a few python scripts that I've written to automate some of my work. My boss found out... 

Boss isn't mad surprisingly! But boss wants me to allow others on our team to use the script so they can do the tasks too. 

My problem is this: my script lives locally on my computer and I run the script through pycharm on my computer when I want to do these tasks. I have no idea how or where to put this script that allows others to use it, AND takes user input (just a couple variables). It needs to be presented in a way that doesn't confuse non-programmers.

Also need to mention that my script works in conjunction with a separate app called chromedriver (IIRC). Its an app that has to be running while I run my script: it allows remote navigation of a website i.e. the computer clicks buttons/links instead of me.

Any advice?

EDIT: not that it's important but I'm finding it curious a lot of comments are calling me 'he'. I'm a lady üòÅ
