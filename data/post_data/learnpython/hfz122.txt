Hey there, I'm a self-taught noob that likes to embark on projects way ahead of my limited understanding, generally cos I feel they'll make my life easier.

So, I'm a DnD Dungeon Master, and I'm trash atbuilding balanced combat encounters. So I thought, hey, why not code a "simple" command line program that calculates the odds of victory or defeat for my players, roughly.

Because, you know, apparently they don't enjoy dying. Weirdos.

Thing is, after writing half of the program entirely out of independent functions, I realised classes \*exist\*, so I attempted to start a rewrite.

Now, uh...I tried to automate it, and browsing stackoverflow has only confused me, so, beware my code and weep:

&#x200B;

`class Character:`

`def __init__(self, name,isplayer,weapons_min,weapons_max,health,armor,spell_min,spell_max,speed):`

[`self.name`](https://self.name) `= name`

`self.isplayer = isplayer`

`self.weapons_min=weapons_min`

`self.weapons_max=weapons_max`

`self.health=health`

`self.armor=armor`

`self.spell_min=spell_min`

`self.spell_max=spell_max`

`self.speed=speed`

`total_combatants=input(">>>>>Please enter the total number of combatants on this battle")`

`print("You will now be asked to enter all the details for each character")`

`print("These will include the name, player status, minimum and maximum damage values, health, armor, and speed")`

`print("Please have these at the ready")`

&#x200B;

`for i in range(total_combatants):`

`print("Now serving Character Number:")`

`print("#############"+i+"#############")`

`new_name=str(input("Enter the name of the Character"))`

`new_isplayer=bool(input("Enter the player status of the Character, True for PC, False for NPC"))`

`new_weapons_min=int(input("Enter the minimum weapon damage on a hit of the Character"))`

`new_weapons_max=int(input("Enter the maximum weapon damage on a hit of the Character"))`

`new_health=int(input("Enter the health of the Character"))`

`new_armor=int(input("Enter the AC value of the Character"))`

`new_spell_min=int(input("Enter the minimum spell damage of the Character"))`

`new_spell_max=int(input("Enter the maximum spell damage of the Character"))`

`new_speed=int(input("Enter the speed of the Character"))`

&#x200B;

As you can see, I have literally no idea how to end the for loop so that it actually does what I want it to, could you lend a hand, please?

Thanks for reading, if you did, even if you can't help :)

EDIT:  Hadn’t explained myself clearly, sorry. Though my basic knowledge is...shaky, the idea was to store the name of each character and map it to each of their other attributes , so that I could later easily call on them for number-crunching. I don’t think pickle is a solution here, but it’s the only one i have had some experience with.

EDIT 2: Thanks y’all! You’ve given me quite a lot of things to try out, I’ll be having a lot of fun with your suggestions! I hope I can help in turn soon ^.^
