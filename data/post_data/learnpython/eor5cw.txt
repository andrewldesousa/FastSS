The program/script can be found [here](https://github.com/glof2/SID).

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance!

This is my first code over 100 lines, so it may be messy, sorry for that.

How to use?

Go to the link given above, and download the program. (The first page given, there's no releases or anything)

Once you got it downloaded unzip it somewhere, and open `usersettings.py` file with any text editor, then fill out the information.

Once that is out of the way open cmd, and download PRAW library.  (`pip install PRAW`), then head over to the directory where `sid.py` is located, and type in `sid.py subreddit_name sorting` (Sorting can be top/hot/new/rising).
