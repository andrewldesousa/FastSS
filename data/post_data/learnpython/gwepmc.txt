I'm a policy consultant and deal with a lot of basic statistics at work, particularly when we create city indexes on various topics (SDG compliance, competitiveness, Sustainable mobility...). We're refining our criteria to make sure indicators on one index do not correlate negatively to each other to make sure they all "row in the same direction". I started ATBS a few weeks ago because there's a lot of Boring Stuff in my work with the idea being to move on to statistics and PyQGIS after that (I'm the official 'Guy Who Does Maps'). So today I did a few searches and created correlation matrices for our past indexes with this code.

>import pandas as pd  
>  
>df = pd.read\_excel (r'Path where the Excel file is stored\\File name.xlsx')  
>  
>\#df = pd.read\_excel (r'Path where the Excel file is stored\\File name.xlsx', sheet\_name='your Excel sheet name')  
>  
>\#this imports only one sheet  
>  
>corrMatrix = df.corr()  
>  
>\#print(corrMatrix)  
>  
>import seaborn as sn  
>  
>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
>  
>sn.heatmap(corrMatrix, annot=True)  
>  
>[plt.show](https://plt.show)() #this is if you want the image  
>  
>df.to\_excel("output.xlsx")  #this exports the excel

Boom. I'd probably have spent a long, long time in Excel dealing with missing values and whatnot and this was done in 10 minutes max.
