Driving along [this road](https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/-41.0025882,145.7407935/-40.9849608,145.6996683/@-40.997629,145.7194357,14.18z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0) takes a few minutes but at no point do you have to move the steering wheel much.

The plan was to pull google maps data, plot points along major roads, and do some math to those points based on my currently undefined curvature criteria. Does anyone have any idea if this is feasible? It would be cool to be able to validate his claim, or find a bigger curve.

Ideally the map data will include road endpoints and it will be possible to plot points along each road to be tested. I'd then run a check that determines the deviation of point 3 relative to points 1 and 2. If the deviation of point 4 relative to points 2 and 3 was within tolerance a counter would increment and the longest succesive run of successful checks would give me the longest constant curve on that road. 

I'd then aim to check every road I could, with some filters around high population areas and filters based on total road length if available to optimise where I could.

Does this seem feasible?

Thanks in advance.
