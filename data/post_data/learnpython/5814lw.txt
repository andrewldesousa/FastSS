I decided it would be fun to give my latest book away for free for 48 hours. So starting today, you can get **Python 201: Intermediate Python** free through [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/py201#) or [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/python201/c/201free). 

If you go with Gumroad, then you will need to use the following offer code: **201free**. Note that if you want to receive updates to the book, you will want to create an account and add the book to your library. 

I currently support the following digital formats: PDF, epub and mobi
