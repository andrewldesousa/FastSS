man......

I paid attention, I was positive. I did everything I could

I have a bachelors degree in STEM, I'm an educated individual.

but I have never felt this lost

I got to the first milestone project where I had to create a tic tac to game and I literally had no idea how to do any of the steps.

please tell me someone else out there has shared my experience 

I'm on here looking to put the shattered pieces of my dignity and self worth back together LOL!

i cannot believe how hard that was
