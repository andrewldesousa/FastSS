Hello, my 13 year old son is creating a python game. Is anyone interested in seeing it and giving positive and negative feedback? As well, is there anything I should do to support him? I am paying for python coding courses.

Edit
I have read these comments. Thank you very much for your help and support. I will ask him to upload his code as suggested. I do not know how to do that but I will ask my husband to help me. Thank you all kind people!
