Ever noticed that some words are repeated over and over in Python programs? Those are Python's reserved keywords, and they form the backbone of understanding the language. Unfortunately they're not all the easiest to grasp, even if your first language is English, and after explaining them, individually, over and over here and elsewhere I decided to put together a pretty long-form resource that I think learners will find useful. Hope it helps! [https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/](https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/)
