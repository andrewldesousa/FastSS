TL;DR - Don't give up if you are just starting out. This will become easier and things will start to make more sense. I am proof.

I have been learning Python properly for half a year or so, on and off. I have recently written a script (with help from this sub!) that is actually useful. I was inspired by another user on here who created a COVID script to display new cases for local school in his region.

The script I've written pulls data from the government API for each city in my region, plots these daily new COVID cases, returns a 7-day rolling average for each city, and a 7-day rolling average for all cities in the region combined. These are then saved to an image and the image is uploaded to imgbb via their API. I then post this on a local Facebook group and to Twitter.

The hope is that this information can help local residents stay informed on how their city is doing.

[Script is here](https://pastebin.com/pBkNDNe3) and sample output added here also [https://i.ibb.co/rcBywdz/10-Nov-2020.png](https://i.ibb.co/rcBywdz/10-Nov-2020.png)

I know the code could do with a lot of refactoring, however I am just happy I have been able to create it, and learn how to use API's. I will look into Tweepy to upload the image to Twitter, however I was having some problems when I initially tried this. Any feedback is appreciated, especially on reformatting/optimisation tips

Any help appreciated, specially on refactoring.

**EDIT:** Wow, I didn't think this little post would gather much traction but thanks for the awards. I hope it has inspired some beginners to keep battling through the hard times.
