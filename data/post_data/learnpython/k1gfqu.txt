Microdict is a new, high performance hash table library for Python that consumes significantly less memory (upto 7 times) and runs faster than Python Dictionaries. Even its underlying optimized C implementation outperforms Google's Swiss Table and Facebook's F14, both of which are state-of-the-art Hash table implementations. Along with benchmarks, Microdict is available here : [https://github.com/touqir14/Microdict](https://github.com/touqir14/Microdict) 

Microdict supports Python 3.5+ on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows systems. You can install it using pip : "pip install microdict" or build it using the setup.py file provided in the github repository. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
