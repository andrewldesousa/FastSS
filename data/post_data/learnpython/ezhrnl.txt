For context, I'm a Stats major with some programming experience. I know how to code in Python from the standpoint of knowing syntax and OOP concepts. Outside of this, I know Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas. I attended a few SWE intern interviews and totally bombed the coding challenges. I was asked about what type of algorithm would be most efficient for the challenge and I had to tell them I had no idea. For HackerRank challenges, I am able to code the solution, but it is nowhere near efficient. If anyone has any Python related DS&A resources which I could use to learn this topic well and that could subsequently help me in these interviews I would really appreciate it!
