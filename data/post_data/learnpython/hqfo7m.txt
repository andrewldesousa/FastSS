I'm a couple of days into learning Python and today I wrote my very first program for an idea I came up with myself, not because the book told me to!

It's a program to determine the value of the discriminant and x in an equation that follows "ax² + bx + c = 0", anyway here's the code:

    # This is for calculating the discriminant when trying to find x in "ax² + bx + c = 0"
    import math
    try:
        print("a?")
        a = int(input())
        print("b?")
        b = int(input())
        print("c?")
        c = int(input())
        def discr(a,b,c):
            discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
            if discriminant < 0:
                print("Discriminant =")
                print(discriminant)
                print("No value for x possible")
            elif discriminant == 0:
                print("Discriminant =")
                print(discriminant)
                print('x =')
                print((-b)/(2*a))
            elif discriminant > 0:
                print("Discriminant =")
                print(discriminant)
                print('x = ')
                print((-b + math.sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a))
                print('x = ')
                print((-b - math.sqrt(discriminant))/(2*a))
        discr(a,b,c)
    except ValueError:
        print("That's not a number")
