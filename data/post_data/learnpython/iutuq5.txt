Hey.

I recently saw someone advertise that they'd be willing to help some lucky folks with automating their daily tasks.

With 8 years experience under my belt and having worked on numerous projects, I want to give back and help others. After all, that's what makes the world go round.

Please drop below some tasks that you carry out on the daily that could be automated - and, I'll help you.

Edit: there’s a whole bunch of stuff to get through, I’m not ignoring you guys. I’ll get round to you all. I’m working on some stuff now for some people, and even being paid to do it too :D thank you so much for your positive response guys, I’m so glad I can be helping some of you!!
