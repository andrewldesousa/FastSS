I can’t stress this enough, the top answers from moderators in the FAQs answer questions about further applications of what you’re learning, beyond what’s in the actual lesson. They also delve into WHY certain things work the way they do, rather than skimming over it and just explaining how to use them. 

Definitely an underrated part of the site
