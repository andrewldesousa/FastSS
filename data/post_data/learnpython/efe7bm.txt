I'm honestly curious for those of you who've stayed on track learning Python: how do you stay disciplined and consistent?

It feels like whenever I have schoolwork in the way, I can't be bothered to pick up the Automate the Boring Stuff book I've had on my shelf for nearly a few months now, or keep practicing. It's winter break now and I'm still struggling to make it a priority.
