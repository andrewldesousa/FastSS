Hi everyone! A few years ago I made a set of cheat sheets to go along with the first edition of Python Crash Course. I recently finished updating the cheat sheets to match the changes that were made to the second edition of the book. These sheets aim to remind you of Python's syntax, but they also include brief explanations of the concepts behind the syntax as well. These are all free to download, and they are not specific to the book - they should be helpful to many people, regardless of what your primary learning resource is. 

The first sheet provides an overview of many basic concepts in Python. Individual sheets cover lists, dictionaries, if statements and while loops, functions,  classes, and more. There are also library-specific cheat sheets for Pygame, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Django. You can download individual sheets, download a pdf that includes all the sheets in one document, or download a zip file that includes each sheet in a separate pdf file. Here's an [overview of all the sheets](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/cheat_sheets/cheat_sheets/), with links to download whichever version is most appropriate for you.

Cheat sheets have been really helpful to me at times when learning a new language or framework, and I continue to use the library-focused sheets when starting new projects. I hope these are useful to many of you as well.
