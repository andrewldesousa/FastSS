I wanted to make this post to motivate those who don't believe in themselves. You can do it, trust me. I started learning programming for the first time about four months ago, when quarantine started. I had no prior knowledge about the subject. In fact, I didn't even start learning how to code as I had some some great interest in it -- rather, I just wanted to do an activity where I could ignore the world around me and just focus on the task at hand. Being a guy who suffered from generalized anxiety disorder and had severe impostor syndrome about math, I would have lost my mind if I didn't find that relaxing hobby.

But I found Python. I started studying each day for at least two hours. And I started falling in love with the art.

Today, 4 months after that day I started, I completed my first "big" project: A lane suggestion algorithm named "Crappy Lane Detection." My program takes the video of a road and suggests a path for a car to to travel on like [this](https://streamable.com/h7hlpz). I even made a [github](https://github.com/rpathak38/Crappy-Lane-Detection) for it, so that people could check it out and verify that I indeed did it. It really works guys, I actually did something cool. It feels amazing.

Now, to my main point of the post. If I could learn the skills needed to do this in four months, **you can too.** If I, a high school kid with severe anxiety and impostor syndrome, could do it, **you can too.** So go out there, build up your dreams, your crazy ideas; **I know you can do it.**

EDIT: Clarifying the title, I started learning Python 3, four months ago. No, there is no Python 4... yet

EDIT 2: Woah, this blew up pretty significantly. I'm overwhelmed by all the positivity I'm seeing, I'm so glad i was able to help motivate you guys :) And thank you, kind stranger, for the gold!
