I am determined to learn python. I want to turn my career and life around. I do not want to be in my dead-end job anymore. But I can't do it alone, so please help me out.

For those who eventually did a career change into programming learning python while working a full-time job, how did you manage your time? What sources did you use?

At the moment, I chose "Python Crash Course" and I intend to read "Automate the Boring Stuff" next.

Also, I don't know exactly in which department I would like to work for, but probably data analytics. But artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics do interest me as well.

Anyway, I would appreciate any tips for this new noob into python world. Thank you in advance!

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*

I'm so thankful for everyone who commented and gave me some tips! I did not expect to get all these answers. So, what I'm going to do is actually enroll in "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" on Udemy which was suggested by u/BigTheory88 and side by side going over what I've been reading already, "Python Crash Course." I've also downloaded "Solo Learn" app, so I can keep studying during my breaks. I'm going to set aside at least an hour during the weekdays to study. And I'll invest more hours to study during the weekends. I'll make short-term goals per day by trying to complete a chapter or concept. I am determined because I want to change my life. I cannot continue to live with my current low-paying dead-end job. I understand and recognize the fact that I need to learn a new skill to get out of my current job and start my new journey into programming. I have a 1 year goal to be hired into a programming job for now. And I am looking forward to the future and myself posting my progress and result, no matter what the outcome. I am optimistic and motivated (for once) to meet my goal. Thank you once again to everyone! I hope to post my failures and successes by April 2020!
