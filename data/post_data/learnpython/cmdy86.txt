I left a career in psychiatry after a car accident caused by a texting driving put me out of commission for several months. I decided to move into a new career in programming. We moved crosscountry to a new state where we knew no one a few months after the accident, and I was trying to figure this all out on my own while dealing with a lot of stuff that was making it harder than it had to be. Hours spent googling, trying, and failing when I couldn't even type for very long in the first place from breaking the stereo with my hand  took a toll on me. Then I find you guys. I wasn't alone trying to figure this out anymore.

I seriously can't tell you how much I appreciate you all for helping us noobs. I can't wait to reciprocate.

tl;dr: Life can suck, you all rock. Thanks!
