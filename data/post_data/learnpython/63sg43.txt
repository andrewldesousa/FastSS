Hi Reddit,

I've recently overhauled the interactive Python coding challenges repo, now with more than double the original content:

https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges

Included are unit tested reference implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

Each challenge has one or more reference solutions that are:

* Fully functional
* Unit tested
* Easy-to-understand

Notebooks also detail:

* Constraints
* Test cases
* Algorithms
* Big-O time and space complexities

Anki flashcards are also available.  Great for use while on-the-go!

Bonus: If you're looking to learn/practice system design or object oriented exercises, check out the sister repo, The System Design Primer:

Hope this helps!
