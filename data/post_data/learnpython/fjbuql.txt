I like helping out people with their problems. And to be honest, I usually skip over questions that have replies in them already.. but sometimes those replies aren't actually helpful to the person that asked the question, and they're left without a proper answer.

I think we should have flairs to show if a questions is solved, among other things.

Some Examples of Flairs we could have here:

* Help Needed
* Solved
* Learning Resources
* Recommendations

Edit: I'm glad to see that many others agree. I sent a message to the moderators for their feed back on this.
