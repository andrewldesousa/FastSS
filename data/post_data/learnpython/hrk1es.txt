My first project is done and dusted. 

`print('What would you like for dinner tonight?')`

`food = input()`

`print(food + ', we had that last week, anything else you would like?')`

`input()`

`print('nah, don\'t fancy that - what else can we have?')`

`input()`

`print('that\'s boring. What do we have in the fridge or cupboards?')`

`input()`

`print('we could have that tomorrow. What shall we have tonight?')`

`input()`

`print('veto. Ask me what I want')`

`input()`

`print('not bothered')`
