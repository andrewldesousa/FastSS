I call this one the "Do you want to see the 99 Bottles of Beer song?" program.

    bobotw = " bottles of beer on the wall"
    bob = " bottles of beer."
    take = "Take one down and pass it around, "
    beer = 99

    def on_wall(beer):
        if beer == 0:
            print("No more" + bobotw + ", no more" + bob)
            print("Go to the store and buy some more, 99" + bobotw + ".")
        elif beer == 1:
            print(str(beer) + " bottle of beer on the wall, " + str(beer) + " bottle of beer.")
            beer -= 1
            print(take + "no more" + bobotw + ".")
            on_wall(beer)
        elif beer == 2:
            print(str(beer) + bobotw + ", " + str(beer) + bob)
            beer -= 1
            print(take + "only one bottle of beer on the wall.")
            on_wall(beer)
        else:
            print(str(beer) + bobotw + ", " + str(beer) + bob)
            beer -= 1
            print(take + str(beer) + bobotw + ".")
            on_wall(beer)

    answer = input("Do you want to see the Bottles of Beer song? (y/n) : ")

    if answer.lower() == "y":
        on_wall(beer)
    elif answer.lower() == "n":
        print("Bollocks to ya then.")
    else:
        print("It's y for yes, n for no.")



There may be more elegant solutions, but this one is mine.
