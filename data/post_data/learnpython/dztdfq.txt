I've read horror stories of people writing a single script that caused a department of 20 people to be let go. In a more positive context, I'm on my way to automating my entire job, which seems to be the push my boss needed to allow me to transition from my current role to a junior developer (I've only been here for 2 months, and now that I've learned the business, he's letting me do this to prove my knowledge), since my job, that can take 3 days at a time, will be done in 30 minutes or so each day. I'm super excited, and I just want to keep the excitement going by asking if anyone here has automated their entire job? What tasks did you automate? How long did it take you?
