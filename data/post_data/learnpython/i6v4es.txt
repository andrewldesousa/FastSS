I'm a few weeks into my journey learning Python. It's my first programming language, and I'm excited. Well... excited and terrified. 

Excited by the adventure. But terrified by the amount of work that awaits. 

It feels like I'm setting out to climb Mount Everest. And with every day of climbing, I get slightly further on the journey. But I also get a clearer view of the mountain ahead, and a better awareness of just how much I don't know.

Anyway, I suspect that since I don't have a background in CS, it may help to step back from "the mountain climb" of Python for a bit. To learn some fundamentals of Computer Science or "computational thinking". 

I recently read and enjoyed "Understanding the Digital World" by Brian W. Kernighan. It's an overview of computers and the internet for someone without a background in CS.

Can anyone recommend other books like this, which may be of assistance on my climb? Thanks!
