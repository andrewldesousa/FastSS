I dedicated my last week learning about data viz in python. I used and learned matplotlib, seaborn, pyplot for creating graphs and doing data analyses using pandas.

My question is how are these things usually applied in Data Analysts job? Do they just create 1 python script per graph? Do they make functions for different types of graphs and export it on their presentations?

I'm asking because I've been in the reports development field for the past 5 years but sadly I've been only using pure SQL for data processing, SSIS/Informatica for ETL, then SSRS for reports and Excel for graphs.

i've never applied python on these apart from some automations here and there. I hope I can get feedback from people who worked in Data Analytics positions before and tell me how are these things applied in their day to day job.

Thank you!
