Hello all,

I seem to encounter a lot of documentation and tutorials that use .format() method instead of f string literals.

Personally,

    print("I can't seem to {} of a {} why someone {} {} {}".format('think', 'reason', 'would', 'prefer', 'this'))

versus

    easily = "easily"
    sentence = "sentence"
    this = "this"
    print(f"A much more {easily} readable {sentence} such as {this}")

F string literal is always much easier to decipher and thus avoid errors.

Perhaps there's some benefit of .format() that I'm unaware of. Googling hasn't brought up much on the debate.

Cheers!
