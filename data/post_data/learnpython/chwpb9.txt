I have zero programming experience and 30 days ago I picked up Automate the Boring stuff.  I am subbed to over 700 subs and I hop between accounts a lot. I decided to write something that would help me subscribe to all my subs every time I pick up a new account. I read here that PRAW is the way to mess around with reddit.

I know this has probably been made here a billion times, but its the first thing I've ever created by myself and I am so incredibly happy.

Thank you to everyone on this sub for all the encouragement, never posted before but I lurk heavy.

Please let me know if there is anyway I can improve/cleanup.
