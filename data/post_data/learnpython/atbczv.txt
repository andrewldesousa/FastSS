I got offered a new job today and took it. I did the coding challenge in flask and the simple interview question in python. I’m just really happy and just wanted to share somewhere. Thanks for all the help guys.


Edit: just realized my title misspelled python. I’m a disgrace.

Edit2: a lot of people have asked about the challenge and the interview question. I can’t really give out details about the challenge due to signing an nda, but i hopes of keeping it somewhat obscure it was to code a website/api that allowed users to register, login, and then save and manipulate some data.

The interview question was checking two strings to see if they were anagrams.

Update: I was originally going to do some stuff in salesforce but my first few tasks are automating browser testing. I’m using python with splinter. I’m soooooooo happy.
