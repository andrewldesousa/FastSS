So, I do know some of the basics of automation. I’ve watched the automation section on automate the boring stuff with python and I’m currently watching a video talking about automating with Selenium. But... There are still some things I don’t get. Like, how do you actually automate stuff like excel, word, and other applications, Do you always have to go to the terminal to run an automation program or do you have to create an application on the desktop, are there certain things I have to download, is it possible to automate someone else’s computer from your computer, etc etc. 

I’m sorry if these questions seem basic to some of you but I’m genuinely confused on this
