I've been working diligently learning python and finally have something to show for it! It felt like a long stay in tutorial purgatory with tons of failures, but I'm starting to feel like I'm emerging :)

My first app is a net worth/personal finance app called [TrackerBE!](https://www.trackerbe.com)

I made it public a few weeks ago, and I'm hoping to find someone that can use it for a week or so and provide some feedback. Let me know if you're interested in poking around :) You basically add financial info, and it tracks trending charts over time. I'm hoping to add enough features and tools to launch a full service in early 2021. Let me know what you think :) Thank you!

EDIT: Here's some screenshots. I'll work on getting a home page built that provides more about the app.

EDIT: Also, for my fellow students of python who feel lost, just keep on trucking along. It sounds cheesy, but you truly don't fail until you quit. Eventually, piece by piece, bit by bit, things start to make sense. Personally, I feel like I had an 'Aha!' moment working on this app where my development speed started picking up and the overall app architecture just started falling into place and making sense. The most helpful resource for me so far on my journey was the edX MITx 6.00.1x Intro to CS and Python course. Keep at it! :)

EDIT2: For those interested, my django app was deployed using Heroku. I found it far easier to get off the ground running. I had some success trying Azure and DigitalOcean, but kept running into problems I couldn't solve with my current knowledge.
