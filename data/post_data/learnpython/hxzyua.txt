To the mods of r/learnpython,

Can we get flairs and require them on all posts? I'm thinking of things like 'Unsolved', 'Solved', 'Code Review', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib', 'CSV', 'Pandas', 'for loops', 'while loops', 'strings', 'lists', 'data structures', 'algorithms', etc. (that is in no way a comprehensive list)

Input from the community would obviously be required before something like this should be implemented, but I think that flairs would improve the experience of this subreddit and better help people looking for help.

Let me know what y'all think.

Regards,
