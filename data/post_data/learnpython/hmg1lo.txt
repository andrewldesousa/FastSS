 I am 28 years old and at a crossroads in my life. I have left my "career" of 10+ years to pursue programming. 

I am by no means a "computer wiz" or even "tech savvy". I never even learned to touch type. (I still look at the keyboard when I type.) 

However,  I've always been interested in programming. My parents are programmers with 30 years of experience, and still to this day generally enjoy it. I thought I could start learning the basics and over time build an understanding of computer language.

I am about a week into youtube "python for absolute beginners" videos. It started off pretty strong and I'm still very interested, its just so many terms and rules just being thrown at me and I cant retain any of it. I understand with repetition it gets easier to understand. But right now I can barely think and comprehend whats being taught.

The overbearing feeling that I am just too dumb to learn something like this is holding me back. It's gotten to the point where I can only take about 30 of trying to learn before the anxiety kicks in and I have to stop.

I really want to do this, I think of all the possibilities of what I can do and create with this language and it keeps me going. I've just been hitting a brick wall recently.

I mostly just need to get this off my chest, but any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for hearing me out.

TL:DR - I'm very interested in learning python, but its proving to be more difficult than I imagined.


Edit: Thank you to everyone for all the kind words and responding so quickly. It's good to know that alot of people are in my shoes dealing with the same issues. All professionals start as beginners.
