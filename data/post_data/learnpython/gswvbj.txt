Hello fellow learners of Python, I have a sort of embarrassing question (which is maybe not Python-specific, but w/e, I've been learning Python).

When I see other people's Git repos, they're filled with stuff like: [setup.py](https://setup.py), requirements.txt, \_\_init\_\_.py, pycache, or separate folders for separate items like "utils" or "templates".

Is there some sort of standard convention to follow when it comes to splitting up my code files, what to call folders, what to call certain files? Like, I have several working programs at this point, but I don't think I'm following (or even aware of) how my Git repository should be constructed.

I also don't really know what a lot of these items are for. All that to say, I'm pretty comfortable actually using Git and writing code, but at this point I think I am embarrassingly naive about how I should organize my code, name files/folders, and what certain (seemingly) mandatory files I need in my repo such as \_\_init\_\_.py or [setup.py](https://setup.py).

Thanks for any pointers, links, etc and sorry for the silly question.

Edit: The responses here have been so amazingly helpful. Just compiling a few of the especially helpful links from below. I've got a lot of reading to do. You guys are the best, thank you so so much for all the answers and discussion. When I don't know what I don't know, it's hard to ask questions about the unknown (if that makes sense). So a lot of this is just brand new stuff for me to nibble on.
