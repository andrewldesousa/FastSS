IDK why I did this, but [here it is](https://twitter.com/bloods_bot).

 Every day, it accuses the most famous person on [Famous Birthdays](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/) of being in [6ix9ine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6ix9ine)'s '[Nine Trey Bloods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Trey_Gangsters)'.

Here's how it works:

* Uses bs4 to scrape Famous Birthdays for celebrity name & picture.
* Uses Tweepy to search Twitter for the name, returns the most relevant user (if the celeb doesn't have a twitter, it still tags the first result which is kinda funny).
* Uses Tweepy to attach media & tweet.
