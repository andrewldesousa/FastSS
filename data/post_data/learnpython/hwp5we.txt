I'm not joking. Started the 'hangman' project in my attempt at 100 days of code, and I'm falling asleep thinking about this project.

I've learned so much just by doing this project.

Basics of state management, update the state, creating functions. Also, list comprehension is becoming easier. Lol.

For real. Start building projects. Just do it. Start small, and then build out. But just build. And when stuck, search stack overflow for an answer.

Edit:

So I am getting a lot of questions concerning a tutorial for this project, like if I followed one or such. I didn't follow one. I pulled the project idea from this [list](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/)

I first planned the program. What that means, I spent an hour so adjusting my thinking in regarding how the guessing game should go. Here is my breakdown in a onenote document  [link](https://imgur.com/a/QvWmdnj)

btw. the onenote contains my thoughts. Tbh, the functions changed. I slept on it, and it evolved. 

Here is the link to my code [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/embed_js/9CA9ebZ3) \- I also created another post after this one, hoping for feedback from the community, that contained my code. I honestly don't know if I should upload to github or not. Being so new, I am just trying to learn and grow. I just didn't expect this one to blow up as it did.

If anyone has any questions, and you don't want to post below, send me a chat or a dm.

cheers!
