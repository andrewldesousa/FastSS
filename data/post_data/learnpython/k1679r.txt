This is by far the best community ive ever seen on reddit and ive been a long time lurker of reddit before i ever made an account. Im a photographer on the side and I thought that was the best subreddit but nope, you guys take the virtual cake. Thank you for all you do!

Sincerely, 

a noob in the programming world. 

P.s. your kindness goes a LONG way and it makes me hopeful that together we can create something amazing. Keep being you Kings and Queens. You dont get enough credit.
