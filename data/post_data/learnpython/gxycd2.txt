When you're starting out like me learning Python, these are the 12 recommended extensions that I currently have installed. I hope it helps you in your learning journey as it is doing wonders for me:

6. Trailing Spaces
7. Visual Studio Intellicode
8. Gitlens

Edit:

* Added:  Gitlens (for those already learned git/github), Docker (only install if you learned Docker), Material Icon Theme, Settings Sync, Dracula Theme
   * Considerations:
      * Themes: Monokai Pro (very cool, I tried it), Material (most popular)
      * Code-Assistant/Auto-Complete: Kite, TabNine
      * Webdev: Minify, Prettier, Paste JSON as Code (for those learning html, css and js)
* Removed:  vscode-icons (sorry microsoft), Code Spell Checker (confusing with other syntax errors)
