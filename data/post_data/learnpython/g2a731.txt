Hope this is a relevant place to share.  Small lesson for my 10yo son on solving problems with computers.

My son was assigned the following [simple math worksheet.](https://imgur.com/gallery/6WFl3DD)

I was really impressed that after completing the first addition, he realised that it was going to be a very menial and repetitive task.  (I'm always encouraging him to learn python and have done a little pygame with him).  He approached me and said, "Dad is there an easier way to do this?"

So I threw together and talked him through this horrible quick and dirty script before allowing him to use it to complete his work:

    shop = [ [ 'soccer ball' , 16.50 ],
             [ 'pencil' , 0.50 ],
             [ 'toy car' , 3.50 ],
             [ 'ice cream' , 4.80 ],
             [ 'yo-yo' , 5.20 ],
             [ 'book' , 17.35 ],
             [ 'piece of cake' , 5.40 ],
             [ 'apple' , 0.75 ] ]
    
    
    items = []
    
    while True:
        print('Welcome to shop')
        print('Press A to add an item.  Press R to restart.')
        action = input()
        if action.upper() == 'R':
            print('starting over')
            items.clear()
        elif action.upper() == 'A':
            count = 0
            for item in shop:
                count += 1
                print(count, item[0], item[1])
            selection = input()
            print('how many', shop[int(selection)-1], 'do you want?')
            quantity = input()
            for i in range(int(quantity)):
                items.append(shop[int(selection)-1])
            print('you have the following in your cart')
            total = 0
            for item in items:
                total += item[1]
                print(item)
            print('total: $' + str(round(total,2))) 
        else:
            print('you said nothing useful')

Obviously it's lacking any technical merit.  But I was just feeling very positive that I was able not just to brag about, but to actually \*show\* him what a computer can do for him.  My daughter's struggling with algebra and I realise that our kids really need to understand WHY they should learn something and HOW it can actually help them in the real world.

Anyway, just want to encourage any parents, uncles, aunts, carers out there to persist with sharing your joy.

EDIT: Wow! I appreciate all the feedback and discussion.  I am highly honored to have received a Relevant XKCD!  Takes me back to my slashdotting days.

ATTENTION NEW / LEARNING PROGRAMMERS: This is throwaway code.  I would \*never\* put this code into a production environment.  Some of the great discussion below (incl. the XKCD) raises the highly pertinent issue of value/time.  You would only write and use code like this when you know 100% it's a one off task and as I mentioned in another post, you control the data input.

There's a value proposition where you have to decide if the time saved on the repetitive task is worth the investment in the code.  Obviously, 1 hour coding to solve 10 minutes of math homework would have been a total waste of time  (with the slight exception that this coding had educational value for a child).  That's why the code is so RUBBISH.  Because I only spent 10 minutes writing it.  As I wrote it, I was aware that there were \*better\* ways to do this.  I know how to use enumerate and dictionaries and validate data types, but this was totally off the cuff.  My only concern was getting the output I wanted with minimum investment, and being able to describe the control flow steps to my son.

Also, for those concerned about him learning math:  I volunteer in his class as a parent helper, specifically working with a small group of advanced math kids, of which my son is one.  I actually told his teacher what we did here and he was really happy about it.
