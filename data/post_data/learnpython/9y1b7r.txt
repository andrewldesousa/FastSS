Consider this a very holiday-themed post. First of all, I'm thankful for this sub and for the members of #pySudyGroup for helping cultivate my skill.

I've been learning Python for almost 2 years now, and yesterday I was faced with a challenge where skills converged to save Thanksgiving. One of our clients at work is a popular local restaurant chain with 6 locations. Every year they take holiday orders for their best food. We built an orders and reports system with Wordpress (ugh, I know) into their main site. Reports that were being generated were necessary so that every location knew what exactly to cook and prepare. For whatever reason, we ran into an issue where they were unable to produce this crucial data using Wordpress. Without this data to give to each location, it meant the cooks would have no idea how to prepare for every order and hundreds of families would show up with nothing to pick up. This could lead to a very dysfunctional Thanksgiving.

Unfortunately, we couldn't find any real connection between orders and categories created by a third-party plugin, so we couldn't produce anything that would show on the front-end using some disgusting mySQL query. Anyways, I figured out that the SKU meta field for orders would show up in CSVs we could generate, and we could also have these orders separated by line items. So, to make a long story short, we created an SKU system for these items so they would have a category (e.g., "bakery-0001, kitchen-0001, kitchen-002").

Within a couple hours, we finally got the number from each report to be like I needed it and then applied some logic (89 lines of Python magic) to make sure the reports could be how the chefs needed it. I finished in time so the chefs could start making and baking and Thanksgiving is saved.

Feels good, man.
