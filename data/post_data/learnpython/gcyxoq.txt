Not long ago I decided to start learning Python and I had no idea or programming background. I found this subreddit and start digging it. Again short time ago I posted some threads they look little bit silly when I look them now. For example:

[Me when I had no idea about programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/emv9c6/is_it_possible_to_be_selftaught_for_an_absolute/)

&#x200B;

From there I followed your recommendations and started with 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python',  I have to admit, sometimes I felt like giving up but managed to hang around and finished it. Then I had silly question again: What to do from here? Then I came up with this topic:

&#x200B;

Again your recommendations gave me new vision. From the replies I created an updated road map. Took some courses about data science (things like pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc.). And again from recommendations I start digging Kaggle, the little I know! At that point I didn't know much, I had theoretical knowledge but I suck at practice. I kept doing some online tutorials while applying my skills to my own projects whenever I learn something new. My projects were like about the games I play; gathering some data about game and trying to find overpowered combinations etc.(Sorry for that, fellow gamers!)

Finally I felt like I can dig the Kaggle again, this time what I had in my bag was some machine learning libraries like sklearn etc. Then I start doing my own projects there, they were(and they still) far from perfect, but I learned a lot on the way. Some of my works are like:

I feel like I'm still a beginner and it's not bothering me anymore, there is so much to learn! I'm already reading about topics like deep learning, neural networks etc. At the same time still learning a lot about the topics I already moved on, reading books and articles about the packages I'm already using and applying them on my old projects is really helping. I still feel overwhelmed time to time, but as I said trying to hang around.

At the end I wanted to thank you for replying my silly questions and giving me inspiration, this is a really helpful community!
