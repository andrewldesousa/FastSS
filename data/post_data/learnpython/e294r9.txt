So I just finished my python script to monitor the price of my target gadget this holiday.  Itâ€™s going to be heavily discounted soon but it will go to the fastest finger. 

Iâ€™ve written a python script with BeautifulSoup. Iâ€™ve also set email and SMS alerts in the script ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Was just wondering if thereâ€™s any other person doing this for Black Friday and Fastest Finger deals.

Update: Long overdue but just thought I should add that I got the phone.
