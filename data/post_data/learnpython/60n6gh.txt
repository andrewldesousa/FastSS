Hi Reddit,

Just wanted to share a recently updated collection of Jupyter notebooks I reference while learning about and working with data.

Topics include:

* Python language essentials geared towards data processing
* Python data stack
* Machine learning
* Deep learning
* Big data processing with Spark, MapReduce, and AWS
* Statistical inference
* Business analyses (ie churn modeling)
* Various command lines
