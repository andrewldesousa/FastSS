very subjective and opinion driven question but in your opinion what is the most enjoyable programming langauge, I've been programming in C++ for about 3 years now. From what I have observed, people say python allows you to think more freely especially with not being bogged down with features such as a language like Java or C++ does. So I'm thinking of learning Python as a second language, is Python the most enjoyable language you have programmed in?
