This promo code works until September 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to SEP2020FREE2 on the 4th.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month. [Meanwhile, the first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code SEP2020FREE or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $16 to $18. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, and I don't get the credit for those referral signups. Blerg.)

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be "good at math" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a "gym buddy" to learn with.
