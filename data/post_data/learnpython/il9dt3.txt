I currently work on Automate the Boring Stuff (Fantastic Book). It has plenty of Practical Projects. Well I solve one by one. Simultaneously I build up a GitHub Pages Website where I document my projects. 

Is this the best process of getting a job? Solving more and more projects? Making them more and more complex? Does this process lead to Real-World Results? 

Thanks guys. Have an incredible day. All the best from Berlin
