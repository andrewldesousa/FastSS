Idk who needs to see this out their but if you're struggling to find the motivation to keep learning python or programming in general, don't give up. What worked for me is finding a project that would challenge me, and set aside time every day(or however often you can) and just struggle through it. Once you make it through, it's one of the most rewarding feelings ever. Every hurdle you jump over in the learning process is one less that you have until you meet your goal. You can do it! I spent 6 hours yesterday struggling to learn canvas' api and I finally got it to work perfectly and now I know so much more about requests, headers, responses, and more. And I'll continue to keep struggling and learning until I've met my goals and move onto whatever's next :). Good luck out there, I believe in you!
