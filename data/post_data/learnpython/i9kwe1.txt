I was re-reading an article about two python pip modules actually being malicious and stealing SSH and GPG keys to compromise developer projects. \[[ZDNET Article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-malicious-python-libraries-removed-from-pypi/)\]

I also read the [discussion on r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/e639nd/two_malicious_python_libraries_caught_stealing/) and the [discussion on r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e5rwit/two_malicious_python_libraries_caught_stealing/). However no one seemed to have asked or explained how to determine if a module is malicious. 

As a beginner, I can't look directly at the raw code of a module and understand everything that is going on but I am always looking at interesting modules from other projects and installing modules suggested by others. So what are some methods to determining if a module is malicious?

Besides monitoring my home network, I'm looking for ways to detect and prevent a malicious module before installing it.

Also has one of the default libraries in python ever been discovered to be malicious? Every other article talking about malicious Python modules are modules from Pypi.
