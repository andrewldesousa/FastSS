I just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone on here that takes the time to teach newbies like me how to code properly.

My journey into programming has been eye opening, especially when I need help understanding how to complete my course assignments.

This has been my experience so far:

StackOverflow - don’t ever ask questions until you are an expert or you’ll get verbally slapped. It’s like you are not worth their time.

Python Discord - people on the help channels seem like they know what they are talking about but don’t help much. Sometimes just like those on SO. In the recent past I asked the same question about 4 separate times and got nothing but dead air.

I’ve tried getting a tutor from Kijiji but all they want to do is complete your assignment for you and charge you $hundreds. I’m not going to learn that way. 

This subreddit seems to be the only place I have found that gives me respect as a beginner and the help I need by providing suggestions.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt degraded or dismissed.

So again, thank you to everyone who takes the time to help new programmers. 🍻
