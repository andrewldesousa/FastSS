I have been lurking around in this subreddit for quite a while and what I have noticed is people ask the following questions a lot:

* What to do after I finish a course?
* What projects should I build?
* What should I learn next in python?

So if you are asking one of these questions this article is for you.

Enjoy!

I would first recommend anybody to learn the following interesting and helpful modules in python like:

1. Beautiful soup to do web scraping.
2. Tkinter for building basic GUI/apps.
3. PyGame for game building with GUI.
4. Os to mess with files and folders.

I would also recommend you'll to go through the book, ["Automate the boring stuff with python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) from [chapter 7](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter7/) if you'll are familiar with most of the stuff in python otherwise start with [chapter 1](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/). Some projects which could be done with those modules are:

1. A very common project with beautiful soup module is scrapping every day's weather forecast.
2. Building a calculator, attendance recorder or an image hub like [pexels.com](https://pexels.com/) with Tkinter.
3. With PyGame there are endless possibilities and trust me game making is not so easy with PyGame though basic projects you'll could build are a flappy bird, a racing game, a top-down shooter game or a side scroller like Mario(well don't try to make the exact replica of Mario because that's tough!!).
4. If you'll want to build something very very basic try building rock paper scissors, cross and nuts, battleship without any GUI and output in the terminal itself.

Another thing which I would recommend is solving problems by going to these few sites

1. [Hackerrank.com](https://hackerrank.com/)
2. [geekforgeeks.com](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

Solving problems might get you'll to be demotivated and to be honest, it got demotivated too but I continued and I got my more confidence back afterwards.

And that's all. Doing these will give you guys a massive skill, knowledge and a confidence boost in python.
