I've already got the basics and I can easily solve the beginners problems on codewars, but when reading the best solution I feel very dumb for not knowing a lot of operators, having difficulties with list comprehension, or even not knowing why it is working at all.

&#x200B;

Should I just solve it in my own way or should I stop and try to write like the best practices?

In my own way I could solve in 5- minutes and find it waay more readable, when trying to write like the best solution I spend like 30+ mins.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your answers, like some people mentioned, this is entirely the point, learning is challenging. I won't care too much about the one line solutions, but I should learn how they work. Got a lot of ideas on where should I head next.
