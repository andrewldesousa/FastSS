Hello everyone, I am 13 years old and I have already been programming python for almost 1.5 years.
I really like to do it and I hope to make my job out of this eventually.
I also really like traveling and so I started thinking of what I could do in the future.

I have been searching and the closest I could find was a freelancer.
My ideal job is to be independent so that I can finish the programs I am supposed to finish no matter where I am.

Is there in this subreddit anyone who has does this kind of job and who could tell me their experience and how they started?

Edit: Thank you all very much,
I really appreciate all your positive and motivating comments.
I will keep on learning programming in order to reach my goal.
Which is to combine programming with traveling.
