[Stephanie](https://slapbot.github.io) is an open-source platform built specifically for voice-controlled applications as well as to automate daily tasks and hence imitating much of an virtual/personal assistant's job. It is written in python and I call it more as a framework than an application.

There are lots of amazing things about Stephanie, and I'd be listing few of them.

- **Beginner Friendly** - The Ultimate goal of this project is to create a general awareness among all sorts of people irrespective of their career background to get them interested in 'building something cool', that's why installation is made quite simpler but not the simplest to help general public learn programming in a very different way where they could feel they are making something cool while learning the essence of programming.
- **Minimal Hardware Requirements**, seriously, you got a machine? windows or linux? a speaker of any sort? headphone, headset and a mic which could be anything like inbuilt, bluetooth or just connect a freaking phone.

- **Privacy**, Stephanie offers lots of engines to adjust your privacy as needed, in contrast to other commercial based applications which tracks all of your data (listening everything)

- **Difference**,  Now you must okay dude, but how is it different from siri, cortana or echo and other commercial softwares?  Well first of all Stephanie is completely open source, even the algorithm which is used to predict the intent (I've written a paper on it which I would highly recommend to anyone interested in this link :  https://slapbot.github.io/documentation/resources/algorithm ) is open-sourced so basically you are using a software which is community driven.

- **Modules**,  So since Stephanie is completely open-source, you can integrate it with lots of public/private API's to take the application to new level, don't believe me, check out some of it's functionality.

Let's take a brief look at social networks, shall we? How about twitter eh?

***You***: Hey Stephanie, Do I have any twitter Notifications?

***Stephanie***: Your latest tweet has been favorited by 20 people, whereas @rayhudon mentioned you stop swooning over real madrid, they ain't gonna win 3 CLs consecutively, that's nuts.

(You can tweet something with the help of stephanie too, similarly I won't be talking about each one, since there are too many functionalities but you are welcome to check it for yourself.)

Okay so How about facebook? Do you ever forget your friends birthdays? well fear not, Now Stephanie got your back.

***You***: Hey Stephanie, Do I have any birthday reminders?

***Stephanie***: Oh Yes! your friend Karan Sachdeva has a birthday today.

Wanna write something in facebook as a wall post to show off among your friends? Cmon be humble dude.

***You***: Hey Stephanie, I wanna do a status update on facebook.

***Stephanie***: So, What's on your mind?

***You***: How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real.

***Stephanie***: 'How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real.' has been put up as wall post.

Now again this is just social networks, there are many more modules to work with, for instance: Ever wanna note something on fly? no worries mate, your **Evernote** Account got your back with it's integration, or maybe you want your unread emails? **gmail** is there for you, **weather updates**? forecast? *latest news** information, forget to wish your mom on mother's day? sync your **google calendar** man. Are you a movie-freak? Jesus, **imdb** got you, **Restaurants suggestions**? **Wikipedia**? **Quick Answers** to general IQ questions? And My personal favorite **Football** Module which has alone more than 30 functions to let you daydream your favorite football team or league.

**DEVELOPER FRIENDLY**,  Now this is the real deal right here, The reason I call it Jarvis v2.0 is because  I believe Stephanie more as a framework than an application and with it's extensive documentation  and a really cool interface you can built one of the most complex and intricate programs with it, Honestly, I feel a person can even create an  enterprise based application from it. The Developer guide written is basically for programmers to guide them on the process of how to write their own modules and extend the functionality of Stephanie, wanna sync up your Quora account? Reddit? Some obscure internet forum? Control your Air Conditioner? Door handles? Wifi Routers? Cool just write your own module and integrate with  Stephanie using a really nice interface which gives you all the functionality needed to built it out of the box.

Or maybe you just wanna integrate some other guy's written module? Awesome with a community and easy integrate methods, do whatever with Stephanie, change it's name to Munni or stick with the current one, It's 100% customizable and the decision is in your hands.


Finally, this is a video where I kind of explain about Stephanie, with few demonstrations if anyone is interested and doesn't wanna read up this post.
