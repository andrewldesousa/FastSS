I got sent an old access database file that I couldn't access since I didn't have a database management system or access installed. Tried to use pyodbc, but was getting a driver error and couldn't couldn't connect. Didn't realize that Access actually had a database driver so I had to get IT to install the 64-bit ACE driver. Then I was able to connect to it, write a SQL query within the pyodbc connection, create a pandas dataframe from the query output, use plotly and dash to create a chart or two and spin up a quick local hosted dashboard to illustrate a quick concept and actually be able to make progress. 

Yes, I could have just imported it all table by table into excel and then use powerpivot to create a sliceable dashboard for each location (which I still might do anyways depending on what the internal customer wants to do), but it was really cool actually having a use case for it and being able to show the internal customer a  quick concept on what it might look like and get some further feedback on what they were looking for.

I'll admit, having to troubleshoot and research error messages and not just be able to go "oh this is too hard" and move on to something else is intimidating. Yes, there was another way I could have done it, but being able to actually put some of my Python knowledge to use at work was a huge morale boost for the learning process.
