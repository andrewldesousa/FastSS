EDIT: Whoops, sorry, I've been... busy... the last few days. I just made the JUN2020FREE2 code, but it might take an hour or so to take effect. They'll show you the $16 "discount" using the link until then, just hold off a bit and check later. JUN2020FREE2 should work until 06/07/2020 around 2pm Pacific.

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: JUN2020FREE (on Monday the code changes to JUN2020FREE2)

This promo code works until June 7th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes 30 minutes or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month. [Meanwhile, the first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code MAY2020 or JUN2020 (or whatever month/year it is) or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $14 to $16. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, which means I don't get the credit for referral signups. Blerg.)

Frequently Asked Questions:

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be "good at math" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a "gym buddy" to learn with.
