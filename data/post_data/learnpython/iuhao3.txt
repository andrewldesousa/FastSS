So I’ve had a bit of experience using JavaScript as I worked as a web developer for experience. I didn’t go too far into it before I left and got a new job where I learn Python now. But what I’ve realised is, all the languages of course do all the basic foundations like arithmetic, lists, loops. And I was wondering, how much further on in terms of learning does it go? Because I found in my web developer role that most of my tasks were solved by just using these basics they teach you at the start. And the only “advancedness” of it was just how creatively you could think about how to manipulate the code to solve your problem. 

Is this really all there is and any new code you learn is really just a step forward in these basics? Or is it a whole new area that I’ve not even scratched the surface of yet?
