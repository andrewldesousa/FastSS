I made a cheatsheet for beginner to intermediate Python users about concepts I think everyone should know. Check it out and let me know what you'd want to see. Suggestions are more than welcome.

Edit: Added a couple string formats! Let me know how I should name the files... Also working on itertools, collections and functools for sheet 2.
