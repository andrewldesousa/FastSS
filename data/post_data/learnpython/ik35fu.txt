currently learning python through the Python Crash Course Book and holy shit I can't understand jack shit about classes

every other chapter in the book was from what I remember I was able to understand easily at the beginning but the chapter on classes makes no fucking sense.


I also tried a video by Microsoft Developer which is my go to YouTube Channel for when I need to look for python related stuff which ended up giving me just as confusing an explanation.


so yeah it make no sense. plz help


EDIT: I have looked through some of the replies and the links in those replies and now I have a much better understanding of how classes work. Thank you all so much :)
