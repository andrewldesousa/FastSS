I’ve struggled for a long time with what I actually enjoy doing. I started learning python a couple months ago and started writing scripts to automate some processes at my job and I really enjoy It! I want to continue doing this to help companies scale as they grow. Is there a job title that handles this? Or are there other skills/languages I should learn to be able to continue to do this?

I’m new to this industry so that may be a dumb question but I have no one to really ask except this community.
