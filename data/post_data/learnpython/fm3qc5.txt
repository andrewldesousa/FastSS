I have finished my first Python Windows Desktop application in a little under a month. Even tho people told me to change language and I found quite a few pitfalls with some libraries . It is a Connectwise Manage employee time manager, with an Active Directory Logon and uses the time entries done by employee and push data to extra data fields. It even print reports in excel and PDF. It's moving to production next week! Thank you to those that told me to stick with it!
