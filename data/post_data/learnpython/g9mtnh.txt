So I started to structure my .py files in a tree and planned to fix the git-connection to back some of them up today. By accident I ended up deleting the .py file of my first fully "personal" project that I just finished. It's gone. I tried several recovery programs and found the file but it's super corrupt, that kinda sucks.  
The code calculated material needed for exterior wall panel, where to cut every single plank, reusing stumps considering placement of studs etc. I highly recommend this type of project as a beginner project as it easily can be extended and improved with new features. But, eventually it turned out the biggest lesson here was to **set up the backup environment first.**

Anyways, project was finished and the hours put in goes into experience bag. :)
