I’ve been helping a few friends get started with things like ATBS. Some say they get bored early on or they essentially go through the motions of doing the example code and don’t retain any information.

This tip seemed to help them and is something I still do.

For example, in ATBS one of the first things you make is a number guessing game. It’s very simple and a great exercises but I remember yawning and not retaining what I was doing. To perk me up I started making it insult the user. Instead of just saying print(‘your number is too high’) I changed it to print(‘you’re too big, something no woman has told you before’).

This got me interested so I wanted to do it more. I then started adding all kinds of IF statements and loops to make the insults different based on how many guesses it was taking, each insulting the user’s mom in the process. Then I wanted an opening to even initiate the program where it would ask if you wanted to play and if you said “no” the game would insult you as well.

All of this turned an 8 line (I don’t remember exactly) piece of code into 30+ while solidifying the concepts because I wanted even better ways for the game to insult me/the user. 

My example is of course childish, but doing something that makes you laugh or at least tailored to your interests will help the early learning process. It could be as simple as instead of a random number guessing game change it to a random Kardashion (spell?) guessing game if that’s your thing.

Edit: a word 

Edit 2: as some users pointed out: students, do NOT use vulgar language in class. The core concept still applies and you can make it fun / funny for you but don’t use anything that could get you in trouble as you might forget and leave it in the code when you turn it in.
