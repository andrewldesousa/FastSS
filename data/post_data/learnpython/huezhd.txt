# 7 Beginner Python Project Ideas

These are some of the beginner project ideas that I have done when I was learning Python. Hopefully, it helps anyone who reads this too. Here are the project ideas:

1. **Any Type of Card Game** \- I personally made Blackjack due to its simplicity, but any other type of card games such as rummy would also work. Building most types of card games can help you master fundamental concepts of Python.
2. **Hangman Game** \- Hangman is a great game to test a person's knowledge of the beginner programming concepts such as lists, loops, and conditional statements. A simple Hangman game on the console is usually recommended for beginners
3. **Strong Password Generator** \- These can make use of the random module that is present in python in order to create random strings of numbers, letters, and symbols. You can also use the String module as I did for the project.
4. **Guess the Number Game** \- This is recommended for the very new Python beginners who only have a few days or a few weeks of experience. This also uses the random module to create a random number that the user has to guess.
5. **Login System -** This is where the program lets a user login to the system and lets them create an account if they haven't. This takes advantage of Python's ability to read and write to text files, which can be used as mini-databases. Highly recommend trying this project out
6. **Mad Libs Generator -** This is probably one of the most common project suggestions that you would find on the internet. But, it's a good one to try. It gives you a chance to experience all the beginner topics in a fun way.
7. **Text-Based Adventure Game -** This might also be one of the most commonly suggested ones, and it does take a long time to build a well-designed, long, and complex game. But, it's definitely worth trying to do as it will be very rewarding in the end.

Let everyone know any other idea in the comments for this post so that they will have a greater variety of options to choose from. Also, feel free to suggest any other types of project ideas (pygame, GUI, intermediate) project ideas that you want to know. I could also share the best youtube tutorial links for particular projects to anyone who wants guidance through these projects. Hope you have great fun building these projects and advancing your Python skills!
