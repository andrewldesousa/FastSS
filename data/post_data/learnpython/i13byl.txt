 I am 28 and have only just begun an introductory course in Python and have never felt more fucking dumb than I do now! From the realization that I need to take algebra lessons to knowing that I am not comprehending the bare basics is fucking demoralizing. Though I find having my hand held through courses like Codeacademy comprehensible. Mostly I feel this way as the introductory course through a Technical College I am enrolled in has an indicative time to complete their first project as 3 hours. All I can say is thank fuck its online because I've been working on it for legit 2 weeks. GOD FUCKING HELP MY DUMBASS LEARN!!
