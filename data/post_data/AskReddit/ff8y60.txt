Recently, users in r/AskReddit have received messages from spam accounts claiming they won a gift card in some contest. These accounts usually contain “mod” in the username, and start their messages by saying “Our Reddit team chose YOU for our monthly raffle for a $100 gift card (Yay!)” to trick people into thinking it is an official subreddit contest. If you received a message like this, please do not click on the link or reply to the account as it this offer is not genuine. Additionally, please report it to the admins [here](https://old.reddit.com/report?reason=this-is-spam) so they can remove these spam accounts from reddit. r/AskReddit does not run contests like this, and official messages from the subreddit will be sent from "/r/AskReddit", not individual user accounts.
